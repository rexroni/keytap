## sdiol: Software-Defined IO for Linux

`sdiol` (pronounced: "style") extends standard IO devices, like keyboards and
mice, with sophisticated features like multi-layered keymaps and network
serving.  Possible use-cases include:

* Converting caps lock into a control key.

* Configuring left shift key to be a shift key when held or an escape key when
tapped.

* Configuring the f key to be an f when tapped or to modify the h/j/k/l
keys to behave like arrow keys while f is held.

* Configure multiple keyboards with different keybindings.

* Share a keyboard and/or mouse between multiple desktop/laptop computers over
the network so you don't have to constantly plug and unplug devices or keep
multiple keyboards and/or mice on your desk.

`sdiol` operates at the device level, so it works equally well in tty, X
windows, or Wayland environments.

## User Guide

See section on `Building` (below) if you want to follow along locally.

Here is the output of `sdiol --help`:

`sdiol` requires a Lua configuration file to run (see `Configuration Reference`,
below, for details).  By default it looks for `/etc/sdiol/conf.lua`, but we
can also specify a file with the `--config` option.

So let's start by creating a file called `conf.lua` with the following content:

    -- the f key will expose an alternate layer of the keymap when held
    f_keymap = {
        -- when f is held, convert h/j/k/l to arrow keys
        KEY_H = KEY_LEFT,
        KEY_J = KEY_DOWN,
        KEY_K = KEY_UP,
        KEY_L = KEY_RIGHT,
        -- also convert u and i to left and right parentheses
        KEY_U = shift(KEY_9),
        KEY_I = shift(KEY_0),
    }

    root_keymap = {
        -- caps lock is way too useless of a key for your home row
        KEY_CAPSLOCK = KEY_LEFTCTRL,
        -- assign f to have different behavior on tap vs hold
        KEY_F = dual_key(KEY_F, f_keymap),
    }

    -- use a case-insensitive regex to identify the keyboard device(s) to grab
    grab_keyboard(".*keyboard.*", root_keymap)

Now we will do a test run:

    sudo ./sdiol local --config conf.lua --timeout 20 --verbose

The argument meanings are as follows:

* `sudo` is required because we are trying to claim hardware devices

* `local` means we are intercepting a local keyboard

* `--timeout 20` means "exit after 20 seconds", so if we lose the ability to
type `ctrl-c`, we don't have to reboot the computer

* `--verbose` will help us debug our config by printing key names after each key
press and by printing device names at startup or after a new device is plugged
in

If you don't see a line like `grabbing <your keyboard name>` you may have to
edit the regex in `conf.lua` before continuing.

Now, while the `sdiol` process is running, you can open a text editor and
verify the following behaviors:

* The caps lock key has become a control key

* Tapping f types an f (but not until the key is released)

* Holding f does not type an f, but instead turns h/j/k/l into arrow keys and
u/i into left/right parentheses for as long as you hold f

* Quickly double tapping f (but holding the second press) will auto-repeat the
f key for as long as you hold the second press

* All other keys behave normally


## Configuration Reference

`sdiol` is configured in Lua.  A config is required, and can either be at the
default location (`/etc/sdiol/conf.lua`) or at a location given by the
`--config` option.

The Lua functions available for configuration are as follows:


### `grab_keyboard(REGEX, MAP)`

Grab any keyboard with a name matching REGEX and assign it a keymap of MAP.
REGEX should be a string and MAP should be a Lua table with string keys.  The
keys of the table should be the names of Linux inputs, as you might find either
through the use of the `--verbose` flag or by looking them up in
`/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h`.  The values in MAP indicate what
action should be taken when the corresponding key is pressed.

There are four types of actions:

* a key name, such as `KEY_A`

* a `dual_key()`, to indicate a key which can one of two actions based on
whether it is tapped or held

* a `macro()`, `shift()`, `ctrl()`, `alt()`, or `meta()` to indicate a sequence
  of keys

* another keymap like MAP, to indicate that a key exposes an
alternate keymapping on the keyboard


### `ignore_keyboard(REGEX)`

Don't grab any keyboard with a name matching REGEX.  Multiple `grab_keyboard()`
and `ignore_keyboard()` functions can be in the configuration, and the first
REGEX to match a keyboard name determines the behavior for that keyboard.


### `dual_key(TAP, HOLD [, CONFIG]])`

A key which takes one of two actions based on how long it is held.  Both TAP
and HOLD should be actions.  Note that TAP cannot be a keymap action, and
neither TAP nor HOLD can be nested `dual_key()` actions.

Dual-mode keys are very flexible.  They are configured by passing a lua table
of configurations as the optional third argument.  The allowable keys in the
dictionary are as follows:

* `HOLD_MS`: a number of milliseconds after which a pressed dual-mode key
will take on its HOLD behavior (default: `200`).

* `DOUBLE_TAP_MS`: the maximum number of milliseconds between when a key is
released and when it is re-pressed for it to qualify as a possible double tap
(default: `300`).  Set to `0` to allow for infinite time, or to `-1` to disable
double tap behavior.  A double tap is when you press a dual-mode key twice in
quick succession, holding it the second time.  This would be desirable if f
were a dual-mode key, but you wanted to get the automatic key repeat behavior
of holding a normal (non-dual-mode) f key, such as to page though a very long
file in `less`.

* `MODE`: By default, a key is considered "held" if it is pressed for longer
than its `HOLD_TIMEOUT` (200ms by default) or if some second key is both
pressed and released before the first key is pressed (press A, press B, release
B, release A).  The in-between case (press A, press B, release A, release B) is
called "rollover", and its behavior is configurable using the optional MODE
argument.  MODE can be one of:

  * `TAP_ON_ROLLOVER` (the default) should be used for making dual-mode keys
    out of normal keys, like f.  When you press f, press another key, release
    f, and release the other key, (a "rollover" situation in typing) you will
    get the behavior specified by the TAP argument (probably a normal f)

  * `HOLD_ON_ROLLOVER` should generally be used for making dual-mode keys out
    of modifier keys, like shift.  When you press shift, press another key,
    release shift, and release the other key, you will get the behavior
    specified by the HOLD argument (probably apply shift to the second key).

  * `TIMEOUT_ONLY` means that the only way to trigger the HOLD behavior is with
    the 200ms timeout.

So a customized dual-mode key action for shift might be created like this:

    root_keymap = {
        -- Modifiers like shift work better with HOLD_ON_ROLLOVER, and my
        -- pinky is slow, so increase the limits for holds and double taps.
        KEY_LEFTSHIFT = dual_key(KEY_SHIFT, KEY_ESCAPE, {
            MODE = HOLD_ON_ROLLOVER,
            HOLD_MS = 300,
            DOUBLE_TAP_MS = 400,
        }),
    }


### `macro(...)`, `shift(...)`, `ctrl(...)`

A macro is series of key names which should be pressed/released in sequence.
`shift()` and `ctrl()` are just macros where a modifier key will be held
throughout.  Key macros are composable, meaning that the key action defined by:

    macro(KEY_A, KEY_B, KEY_C, shift(KEY_A, KEY_B, KEY_C))

would type `abcABC` when triggered.


## Serving Over A Network

A note on terminology: Here, the "server" refers to the machine with a keyboard
and/or mouse plugged in to it, and the "client" refers to the machine on which
you want to receive keyboard and/or mouse events.

Using `sdiol serve` effectively has some additional requirements:

* Have working `ssh` access from the client to the server.

* Install the openbsd variant of netcat installed on the server (or an
appropriate substitute).

* A working knowledge of file permissions so other users with access to the
server are not able to log all your keystrokes.


### Configuring the `sdiol` server

A simple `/etc/sdiol/conf.lua` for grabbing a keyboard and mouse might look
like this:

    grab_keyboard(".*keyboard.*", {})

    -- future mouse support will include mouse-specific features,
    -- but until then mice are grabbed with grab_keyboard()
    grab_keyboard(".*mouse.*", {})

Then, assuming your user name was `bob` and you wanted to make sure that only
your user could access the `sdiol` server, you could start it like this:

    sudo sdiol serve /run/sdiol.sock --chown-socket bob:bob

Be sure to check out the `--chown-socket` and `--chmod-socket` options and make
sure you get the correct permissions on your socket for your environment.


### Connecting the `sdiol` client

`sdiol` does not do secure networking at all, so instead we will use `ssh` to
encrypt the connection to the server, then on the server we will use `nc` to
connect to the socket.  This leaves `sdiol` to simply read events from stdin:

    ssh bob@myserver nc -U /run/sdiol.sock </dev/null | sudo sdiol read

And you're in business!

(The `</dev/null` is to make sure that the command works ok with background
execution, where trying to read from stdin may behave oddly)

If a new client connects to the `sdiol` server, the first client will be
disconnected.  In the future, `sdiol` will be able to maintain multiple client
connections and will support cycling through them using a keybinding on the
shared keyboard.


## Building

First install dependencies:

* Archlinux: `sudo pacman -S libsystemd liblua cmake`

* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libsystemd-dev liblua5.3-dev cmake`

Then run the following build steps from the `sdiol` directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make


## Installing

From the build directory, just run:

    sudo make install

When you are satisfied with your `sdiol` configuration at `/etc/sdiol/conf.lua`,
you can start `sdiol` as a background service:

    sudo systemctl start sdiol.service

    # Then make sure it's working:
    sudo systemctl status sdiol.service

And if you want `sdiol` to start automatically on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable sdiol.service
